Preparation
Missing Data Handling:
To ensure the integrity of the data, the project begins by checking for missing data. Rows containing missing values are removed from the dataset to avoid potential biases in subsequent analyses.

Duplicate Removal:
Duplicates within the dataset can skew analytical results. Therefore, the dataset is scanned for duplicate entries, and any duplicates found are removed to maintain data accuracy.

Correlation Analysis 

Scatter Plot: Gross vs Budget:
A scatter plot was generated to visually inspect the relationship between the gross and budget variables. This plot provides an initial insight into the potential correlation between these two factors.

Correlation Matrix:
A correlation matrix was computed to quantify the relationships between all numeric columns in the dataset. This reconfirms the positive relation between budget and gross and also shows a positive relation between votes and gross.
