Overview

This project focuses on data cleaning using SQL, where I aimed to enhance the quality and usability of our dataset by addressing various data quality issues.

Steps Taken

Standardizing Date Format: I began by ensuring consistency in date representations across the dataset, which involved converting various date formats into a unified format to facilitate easier analysis and interpretation.

Data Imputation: Next, I identified and filled missing data where appropriate, while maintaining data integrity.

Address Parsing: I parsed the address column into separate components such as address, city, and state. This restructuring aimed to enhance the usability of the address information for further analysis and visualization.

Column Cleanup: Finally, I removed obsolete columns that were deemed unnecessary or redundant for our analytical purposes, streamlining the dataset and improving its clarity and efficiency.
